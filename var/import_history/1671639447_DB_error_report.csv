6Fl,,Default,simple,"Default Category, Floor Tiles/Ceramic/Henley",base,"Henley™ Warm Tile","Inspired by Victorian encaustic design. It's made from ceramic with a matt finish. The pre scored grout lines are made to look like grout joints, creating the appearance of four tiles rather than one large one. Occasionally, a very faint micro line may appear on the surface: this is simply a characteristic of the digital printing technology used and won't compromise the final effect. 

Embodying all things pattern, the Statements™ range brings together different design eras into a format reminiscent of traditional encaustic tiles. The pre-scored lines make these tiles easier to lay but also give the look of four smaller tiles once grouted.","Product Colour:          Orange, Patterned, Multicoloured
